				<h1>POSITIONING RELATIVES</h1>
				<p>In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world’s first photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

				<h1>BORDER BOTTOM LINE</h1>
				<h2>Awful immigration laws from around the world.</h2>
				<p><strong>Italy</strong> penalizes illegal immigrants with a fine of €5,000-10,000 and allows immigration officials to detain them for up to 6 months. •  <strong>Switzerland</strong> immediately deports all convicted criminals from other countries and potentially even their family members. •  <strong>Australia</strong> detains all non-citizens without a valid visa.•  <strong>Japan</strong> is allowed to pay $3,000 to each unemployed Latin Americn immigrant of Japanese descent and $2,000 to each of that unemployed worker’s family members to return to their country of origin.• The <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> prohibits foreigners from engaging in any sort of labor union-like activity, resulting in harsh living conditions, 80-hour work weeks, back-breaking manual labor, and below-minimum-wage pay.</p>

			<section id="overflow">
				<p class="textRight" id="overflowOne">On the night of Aug 8, 1975, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province's <strong>Banqiao Dam</strong> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.</p>

				<p id="overflowTwo">Just after 1:00 am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, "The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!"</p>

				<p id="overflowThree">There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it "sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking." The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives. </p>
